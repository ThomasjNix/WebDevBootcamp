<h1>Hello! This is a repo dedicated to my journey of Colt Steele's <em?>Web Developer Bootcamp</em>!</h1>

<p>I started this bootcamp because I am passionate about becoming a web developer, and while I had bits and pieces of knowledge on both front end and back end technology, I did not really have a concrete or professional structure on what I knew, and as such I struggled with developing. <strong>By all means, I am not taking this bootcamp because I don't think I can learn on my own</strong>, but rather because I feel that one of the best ways to learn is to interact with those that have already experienced and learned from the same challenges you will inevitably face. Due to the very strong structure and level of detail in explanation of this bootcamp (as seen by the very high reviews it has), I decided that it would be in my best interest to go through it, video by video, example by example, and take notes, and practice as I went. 
<br>
<em>ahem, also it was on sale</em>
<br>
Anyway, this repo will serve as a reference for me, and as a way to show what I have learned. A lot of the earlier things I do already know, but no amount of practice is <em>bad practice</em>, so bring it on! I welcome anyone that is interested in learning as well to read along with my notes and view what I write!
<br>
The plan is to learn with this bootcamp for 2-3 hours per day, about twice the length of a typical college course, so I look forward to seeing how much I can advance!</p>

<h3>Happy coding!</h3>
