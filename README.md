<h1>Hello! This is a repo dedicated to my journey of Colt Steele's <em?>Web Developer Bootcamp</em>!</h1>

<p>I started this bootcamp because I am passionate about becoming a web developer, and while I had bits and pieces of knowledge on both front end and back end technology, I did not really have a concrete or professional structure on what I knew, and as such I struggled with developing. <strong>By all means, I am not taking this bootcamp because I don't think I can learn on my own</strong>, but rather because I feel that one of the best ways to learn is to interact with those that have already experienced and learned from the same challenges you will inevitably face. Due to the very strong structure and level of detail in explanation of this bootcamp (as seen by the very high reviews it has), I decided that it would be in my best interest to go through it, video by video, example by example, and take notes, and practice as I went. 
<br>
<em>ahem, also it was on sale</em>
<br>
Anyway, this repo will serve as a reference for me, and as a way to show what I have learned. A lot of the earlier things I do already know, but no amount of practice is <em>bad practice</em>, so bring it on! I welcome anyone that is interested in learning as well to read along with my notes and view what I write!
<br>
The plan is to learn with this bootcamp for 2-3 hours per day, about twice the length of a typical college course, so I look forward to seeing how much I can advance!</p>

<h3>Happy coding!</h3>

<h2><strong>Update:</strong></h2>
<br>
<p>At this time I have finished the HTML and CSS sections of the web development bootcamp on Udemy. As previously stated, I did know a lot of this already. However, there were a few things I learned, and I feel that goes to show why it's good to review new sources, even if you are comfortable with the content. Although my HTML and CSS knowledge has not dramatically improved, I am satisfied that I picked up a couple new trick.</p>

<p><em>About the upcoming sections</em>: The upcoming sections are focused on JavaScript, and will likely not contain much content that will be placed into web documents. As such, most of this content will be in the form of notes. It is worth noting also that I have recently finished another Udemy course, <em>JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts</em> by Anthony Alicea, a wonderful video series. Nevertheless, I will be taking in depth notes on this course (my notes for Anthony Alicea's course are written on paper), because no amount of review is <em>bad</em> review.</p>
<br>

<span>I look forward to this next section and submitting what I learn!</span>

<h2><strong>Update:</strong></h2>
<br>

<p> I have at this point in time completed the front end portion of this course, and I have learned quite a bit, even about the things I was already pretty familiar with. From this point on, most work will be done in the <strong>Cloud9 Online IDE</strong> so that local code can be deployed to a local server. This could be done off my local machine, but to better align with the course, I will also be using Cloud9. <strong>Updated:</strong> I have decided to simply link a seperate github repo for the back end coding that I will be doing on cloud9, and for simplicity, also include notes on future sessions in the cloud9 repository. The link is listed below.</p>

<h3>Happy coding!</h3>
