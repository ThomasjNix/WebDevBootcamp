Basic HTML
==========

The general rule: <tagName> Content </tagName>
Content is sandwiched between an opening and closing tags,
and these tags dictate what element the content is used in.

Structure
=========
Every page has to have a specific underlying structure. These nested tags are:

<!DOCTYPE html>
html
	head
		title
	body
html

This indicates that the HTML uses HTML5 to the browser.
This biolerplate has a keyboard shortcut in Sublime ("HTML /tab/")

Tags
====
html : Represents the root of the HTML document, all other elements must be descendants of this element
head : Provides general information and metadata about the HTML document (links, title, stylesheets, etc.)
title : Determines the page title (in the tab), as well as gives titles of pages for search engines
body : All of the content of the page goes in the body
h1 : largest header for HTML
div: A generic container (via MDN), a way of grouping things together (block level element)
span : Another type of container, but is inline 
img : a self closing image tag, indicate image source with src=""
a : anchor tag, used for links. href="url" indicates where the anchor will take you when you click on it (anchors are inline elements)
	->to make links explicitly use HTTP instead of the file system, http:// needs to be used (absolute path)
	->this is not the same when accessing other pages on the same directory (relative path)


Comments
========
<!-- Comment --> : How to write an HTML comment, will not be read as actual content by the browser (Sublime allows you to select a line and CTRL+/ to comment it out)

Lists
=====
ol : a list with numbers
ul : list with bullet points
li : list item, the contents of a list
Tags can be nested inside the <li> as well, including other lists

HTML Attributes
===============
Takes the form of a key-value pair, give properties to HTML elements
Not all attributes work on all elements, some only work on one
Example: <img src="image-source.extension"> (img is a self-closing tag)
