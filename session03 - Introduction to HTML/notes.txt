Basic HTML
==========

The general rule: <tagName> Content </tagName>
Content is sandwiched between an opening and closing tags,
and these tags dictate what element the content is used in.

Structure
=========
Every page has to have a specific underlying structure. These nested tags are:

<!DOCTYPE html>
html
	head
		title
	body
html

This indicates that the HTML uses HTML5 to the browser.
This biolerplate has a keyboard shortcut in Sublime ("HTML /tab/")

Tags
====
html : Represents the root of the HTML document, all other elements must be descendants of this element
head : Provides general information and metadata about the HTML document (links, title, stylesheets, etc.)
title : Determines the page title (in the tab), as well as gives titles of pages for search engines
body : All of the content of the page goes in the body
h1 : largest header for HTML



Comments
========
<!-- Comment --> : How to write an HTML comment, will not be read as actual content by the browser (Sublime allows you to select a line and CTRL+/ to comment it out)
