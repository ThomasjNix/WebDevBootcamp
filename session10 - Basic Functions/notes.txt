JavaScript and Functions
------------------------

Functions are reusable pieces of code. They must be defined and given a value, and then when they are called later, the function code will run. 
	convention is to use camel casing

Synax: 
function doSomething(){
	//code
}; //Code is declared. Without parenthesis, it is just the function definition, and will not run. () makes the code run. 

doSomething(); //code runs

Arguments
---------

Arguments are pieces of data that can be passed to functions in order for them to operate with. 
	Ex: function doSomething(argument){
		console.log(argument);
	};

	doSomething("Hello!"); //"Hello!"
	=> Functions can have multiple arguments, any extra arguments will be ignored and any missing arguments will be set to undefined (this excludes some uses of the arguments keyword)

The Return Keyword
------------------

The return keyword allows a function to send a value back after it is completed. Functions don't HAVE to return anything explicitly, they will return undefined if a return isn't specified, but the ability to take data, process it, and give back a value
is what makes functions very powerful. 
	=>As soon as the return statement is used, execution of the function is stopped.

Ex: 
	function multiplyByTwo(num){
		return num*2;
	};

	multiplyByTwo(5); // 10

Function Declaration vs Function Expression
-------------------------------------------

Function Declaration: A function declaration is a definition of a function as we've seen, 
	function funcName(){ //code }; <-- Notice the semicolon!

	whereas a function expression is a function that is set equal to a variable name.

	var funcName = function(){ //code }  <-- Notice no semicolon!

	What's the difference?

	Function expressions can be changed, for example if funcName = 10; was used, the function would be lost.
	Function declarations don't have this as an issue (or perk, depending on how it's used).

	Function declarations are also hoisted (more on that later), so at run time, function declarations will have a value (the function) and function expressions will be 
	undefined until the JavaScript engine reads and processes what the variable is being set equal to.


Scope
-----

Scope is the context where any given code is being execuded in. There are multiple levels of scope, and scope can be nested.
Scope is one of the most important aspects about how JavaScript operates. 

	function doThing(){
		var y = 20;
		console.log(y); // 20
	};

	console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined, because y is defined inside the scope of the function doThing, and is not visible outside of that scope

However, the inverse is true for nesting the other way around.

	var y = 100;

	function doThing(){
		console.log(y); // 100, because the function is accessing a variable on a scope surrounding itself.
	};

Parent scopes can not access child scopes, but child scopes can access parent scopes.

	var y = 100;

	function doThing(){
	var y = 20;
		console.log(y); // 20, 
	};

	console.log(y); // 100
Notice how above the y value stays the same outside of the function. That's because y is declared again at the scope of the function, that is a NEW varaible is created, but because the parent scope
doesn't have access to that variable, the variable y in the parent scope is not affected. This is not the case with the below example however. 

	var y = 100;

	function doThing(){
	y = 20;
		console.log(y); // 20, 
	};

	console.log(y); // 20

This is because y is not being created again at the function level, but the value is simply being changed. Since the child scope DOES have access to the parent scope, it "reaches up" to get and set the value of y. That is why when we log y again at the end, the value has changed.

Two scopes on the same level also can not access each others variables, they are scope-specific. 

function one(){
	var x = 1; 
}

function two(){
	console.log(x); // Error
}
