Extended notes

Intermediate HTML
=================

table element : <table>
table : overall table
	->tr : table row
		-> td : table data
th : table header

thead : Not any difference in appearance of page, but more informative to screenreaders and such (as per HTML5 goals)
tbody : Not any difference in appearance of page, but more informative to screenreaders and such (as per HTML5 goals)


Forms
=====

form : overall form (block level)
input : any type of user input (text field, radio button, check box, etc) (self-closing)
label : text for a form field
	-> Syntax 1: <label>Username: <input type="text"></label>
	-> Syntax 2: <label for="username">Username: </label>
				 <input id="username" type="text">

action : attribute, the URL to send the form data to
method : the type of HTTP request it is (POST, for example)
type : indicates what type of input it is (checkbox, radio, text, email, password, submit, etc.)

placeholder : Adds text to the textbox, it is temporary and is removed when the user alters the textbox
name : attribute that holds the value of the input and stores it in the query string
	-> ? and then key-value pairs seperated with ampersands
		-> ?username=UserName123&password=Password123
checkbox : checkable item that can be toggled on and off, multiple checkboxes can be checked
radio button : similar to a checkbox but only allows one per group (type="radio") and cannot be unselected once selected
dropdown : <select> and <option> tags used for dropdown lists, similar structure to lists
	<select>
		<option></option>
		<option></option>
		<option></option>
		<option></option>
	</select>
	-> Provide name for form submission, it is the title of the key and the option selected is the value
	-> value attribute on option can be used to substitute the option text with another string for the value of the key-value pair
textarea : <textarea> tag used, can specify how large the text area is with row and column attributes.
	->name needs to be given to send in query string

Form Validations
================

Abiltiy to enforce rules or structure on a form
	-> (ex: password must be at least 8 characters)

required : attribute used for form validations. It is a boolean attribute, the fact that it's present makes it true
	->This means that empty fields are not allowed
For other types of validation, changing required is not needed. All that is needed is to change type to the appropriate type (ex: email, password, etc.)
value : sets the value for radio buttons and check boxes for form submission

IF A BUTTON IS THE LAST ELEMENT IN A FORM, IT WILL SUBMIT THE FORM.
