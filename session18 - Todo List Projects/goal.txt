This Todo list application is a combination of everything covered so far

HTML - Appropriate structure
CSS - Styling and responsivity
jQuery / JS - Functionality; local CRUD operations and creating new elements / removing elements 


What should be able to happen:

Create new items and add to the list
Delete items and have removed from the list
Update items and have the changes applied to the list
Hide the form to just see the list 
Respond to resizing 
Aesthetically pleasing

New things in this session:

jQuery:
	.append and creating new elements
	.parent
	Creating elements 
	Event delegation

CSS:
	font-awesome (icons)
	box-shadow
	transition
	gradients


Note: Since this session has an emphasis on file and folder structure, I will not be following the typical naming convention. The following session is a bonus project, and then comes the backend basics.	At that point, it appears that work will switch to cloud9 online IDE. More to come on that later.
