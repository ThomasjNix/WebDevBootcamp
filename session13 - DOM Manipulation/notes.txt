DOM Manipulation
================

//Define what the DOM is
	DOM is the Document Object Model. It is the interfact between JavaScript and the HTML+CSS on the page. 

	HTML-
		|-- DOM -- JS
	CSS--

	Everything stored inside of the document object is part of the DOM. That means ALL the HTML on the page in the document is the entirety of the DOM.

	console.dir(document) will print the ENTIRE document object in JS object syntax

//Understand why DOM Manipulation is awesome
	DOM manipulation is the most important part of interactive web browsing, as it allows functional code to apply to web page elements. This means that a user can actually interact with elements and they can respond conditionally, and that's the essence of every type of application, whether it's games, social media, etc.

//Understand the SELECT, then MANIPULATE workflow

	SELECT and element and then MANIPULATE it. This is the workflow. You use JS to get an elements information, and then you use JS to manipulate that element on the page. 

	For example
		Assume there is an h1 that is standard as they come, and you want to give the H1 pink text and a blue background (for some aweful reason)
		1. Select the H1
		2. Manipulate the text color and make it pink
		3. Manipulate the backgorund color and make it blue 

		(select H1 element and set var h1 equal to it);
		h1.style.color = pink;
		h1.style.background = blue;




***DOM Selection***
-------------------

Some less important but still neat selectors:
	document.URL // returns the URL
	document.link // list of all the links on the page
	document.body // the entire body of the page
	document.head // the head section of the page

But... all the selectors used for DOM manipulation are build in to the document.


document.getElementById()
	Selects an element that has the particular ID provided. Since only one element per page can have a specific ID, this returns a single element.
document.getElementsByClassName()
	Similar to the first one, however since a calss can occur as many times on a page as you'd like, this will return a list of all the elements on the page that have the specified class name. (Not an array, but a list. It's similar to an array, but it's not exactly a JS object, so it won't have JS Array methods and properties necesarrily)
document.getElementsByTagName()
	Very similar to the previous one, but selects by tag name instead of class. So you would use li or h1 or div instead of the class.
document.querySelector()
	A newer method that simplifies selection. This returns the first element that selects a CSS Style selector (#idName, .someClass, div#idName.someClass, etc.)
		document.querySelector('#idName');
document.querySelectorAll()
	The same as querySelector(), but returns ALL elements that fit.

	=> Only querySelector and querySelectorAll need the CSS markup for selection, like # and ., the others would be .getElementById("idName") or .getElementsByClassName('someClassName')

DOM Manipulation
----------------

There are many ways to manipulate elements, here are a few common ones:

	Changing an element style
		When the DOM is constructed, a property called style is added to each element. It's a huge element and has a property for every possible CSS property.
			You use <element you selected>.style.<CSS property you want to change> = "<style property you want to set, MUST BE A STRING!>";
				=> document.getElementById('someH1Element').style.color = "blue";
			=> If you are changing a lot of properties, there is a better way. Changing 5 styles isn't DRY, and it doesn't follow the seperation of concerns
				=> Seperation of concerns : JS, CSS, HTML are responsible for their respective domains, and we want to limit the overlap that each has over another's domain. Don't write CSS with your javascript, and don't use your HTML file as a script page, etc.
				=> If you're changing a ton of elements on an element, just create a class in your CSS file and add it with JS when needed.


	Adding / Removing classes
		1. Create a class
			.className{
				property: value;
				property: value;
				property: value;
			}
		2. Select the element
			var someElement = document.getElementByID('someId');
		3. Add the class
			someElement.classList.add('className');

			=> Now someElement has the class className, and all styles assigned with it!

			Other classList uses:

			classList.remove // removes a class from an element

			classList.toggle // removes the class if the element has it, adds it if it doesn't.

		=> classList is technically not an array, so .push will not work. It has it's own .add function, use it.


	Changing the content of a tag

		Sometimes you don't want to change an element itself, but rather the content inside of it. There's .textContent
			=> Be aware, .textContent will get rid of any HTML tags inside an element if you set with it. 

		1. Select the element
			var someElement = document.getElementByID('someId');
		2. Get text
			someElement.textContent // returns the text inside the element. Does not include any HTML tags present!
		3. Set text 
			someElement.textContent = "whatever" // congrats, you made your web page apathetic.

		To maintain the HTML structure when changing the text, use .innerHTML
			=> This is similar to .textContent, but it keeps HTML tags and will return them if read. 
			=> .innerHTML can be useful for setting HTML structure when operating with JS, but it's more common to simply read with it for conditional purposes

	Manipulating attributes of a tag

		getAttribute()
			You can get the value of an elements attribute with <element that you selected>.getAttribute("<attribute name>"); 
				someElement.getAttribute("href") // <the href of the attribute>

		setAttribute()
			You can also set an attribute of an element, this takes two arguments, the first of which is the attribute name, the second is the value
			<element that you selected>.setAttribute("<attribute name>", "<value you want to set>"); 
				someElement.setAttribute("src","href")
			=> Note : when setting href or src, be sure to use http:// or https:// to let the browser know the link isn't relative to where you currently are.
