Font and Font properties
------------------------

cssfontstack.com to see what support a font has across different systems


font-family : Determines the font of text
	=>font-family: "Arial", Verdana; 
		->This has Arial as the text font, and Verdana if Arial isn't supported. The quotes aren't necessary unless the font begins with a non-alphabet character.
font-size : determines how big the font is. 
	-> Available values : px (pixels), em, rem
		->em is a relative font size. An em is equal to the font-size of the family
		->rem is the font size of the root element
		->Typically a font-size is set at the body level so all top-level elements with em can have the same scale across browsers (default font size changes between browsers)
font-weight : The weight of the font determines how thick the lines are
	->bold, or some fonts will allow a numeric value in hundreds between 100-800
line-height : controls the height of a given line, i.e how much space there is between lines
	->line-height: 2; is double the default line height.
text-align : Tells where the text is aligned within a given element (left, right, center)
text-decoration : used to give an underline, overline, strikethrough, etc.


Custom Fonts
------------
To include custom fonts in CSS, include them in the HTML file and reference them via the CSS property font-family.
