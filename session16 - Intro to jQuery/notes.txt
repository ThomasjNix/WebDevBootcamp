Intro to jQuery
===============

What is jQuery? 
	jQuery is a JavaScript DOM Manipulation Library. It is the most popular JS tool / library, and it is very useful in concisely selecting and manipulating the DOM.

Why use jQuery? Why not?
	Reasons for:
		jQuery was originally created to fix some issues with the DOM API. jQuery made it quicker and easier to use the DOM API.
		It makes your code clearer in shorter in a lot of instances due to a lot of the actual functionality being handled by the jQuery library
		Cross browser support means it can handle polyfilling to keep compatibility across browsers
		Provides AJAX, useful for server calls
		Large community with a lot of support

	Reasons against: 
		DOM API is no longer broken, so the original purpose is moot
		jQuery doesn't do anything you can't do by yourself. Even if it makes it shorter and more concise, jQuery IS JS, and you can do it yourself. 
		An unecessary dependancy. why require such a large package when it doesn't make anything possible that wasn't already? Besides if you only use it for a few pieces of functionality, there's 		probably smaller libraries out there that can do the same thing without all the extra weight
		Performance. In some cases, a developer may not know that certain jQuery code is inefficient, causing performance drops
		People are moving away from jQuery. There is still a lot of support, but people are moving to other libraries as well.

	So is it worth it? It's worth knowing at least.

Including jQuery
----------------
	jQuery needs to be included so it can be loaded into the page. You can either include a file via local href, or by including the jquery CDN (takes load of local server)

Selecting Elements
------------------

	Select, manipulate. 

	Selecting: jQuery selects elements with the $(<CSS Selector>) operator. 
		ex: $('div'), $('#someId'), $("div, p, span, h1") // Last one returns multiple elements!

		$("elem1 elem2") will select all elem2 nested inside of elem1

	ManipulatingL the .css property is used to change CSS values with the syntax .css(property, value) using strings.

		Ex: $('h1').css('color','red');

		=> You can also use object syntax with a set of styles!

			var h1Styles = {
				color: red;
				background-color: black;
				font-size: 2em;
				text-decoration: strikethrough;
			};

			$('h1').css(h1Styles);

		=> You can even add styles to all elements of a list!

			// Assuming you have a ul with a bunch of lis

			$('li').css('color','purple');

			Now all <li> on the page have purple text!

	.last() returns the last element from a given selection that returns a list of elements, .first() returns the first

Common jQuery Methods
---------------------

.val()
	Helps to extract the value of an input. .val is a jQuery wrapper for .value
		Not passing any arguments will return the value of any given element(s)
		Passing an argument will set the value of any given element(s)
.text()
	Produces the text content of the element selected, just like .textContent
	Passing in a value to .text() sets the value of textContent to that passed in value
.attr()
	Used to retrieve the value of an attribute for the first element in a set of matched elements or to set one of more attribute for every element matched
		.attr('href'); // returns href of an element
		.attr('href', '<some href>'); // now some element has <some href> as the value of the href attribute
		.attr({
			href: "<some href>",
			alt: "<some alt>"
		}); // now some element has both of these attribute values
.html()
	Similar to .innerHTML in the same way that .text() is similar to .textContent, is used in the same way (getting and setting)
.addClass()
	Adds specified class(es) to all elements in the set of matched elements
.removeClass()
	Removes specified class(es) to all elements in the set of matched Elements
.toggleClass()
	Works just like classList.toggle, either adds the class if the element(s) doesn't have it and removes the class if the element(s) do.

=> These follow the getter and setter paradigm for the most part, where one functionality is used to retrieve a value and the other functionality is used to set a value.
